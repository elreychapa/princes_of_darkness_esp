 POD_anteshunttroile.1.t:0 "The Hunt: Digging The Past"
 POD_anteshunttroile.1.desc:0 "Troile isn't an hard [antediluvian|E] to find. It is common knowledge that she is buried under Carthage, left to rot here after her fateful defeat against the Roman coalition. This story is the premise of the still running Brujah/Ventrue rivalry but it lacks some crucial details.\nWhat is exactly under Carthage tonight? What kind of defenses are protecting the place? Is Moloch, Troile's infernal lover, still there as well? You need answers, and you will have other people look for them in your stead. Just stumbling in Carthage's ruins would be foolish, and you are old enough to pay other people to be foolish instead."
 POD_anteshunttroile.1.a:0 "Put a bounty on information related to Carthage."
 POD_anteshunttroile.1.b:0 "I can use some old favors instead."
 POD_anteshunttroile.1.c:0 "I already have an idea about what is waiting there..."
 
 POD_anteshunttroile.2.t:0 "The Hunt: Escape Plan"
 POD_anteshunttroile.2.desc:0 "From the (few) adventurers who came back from Carthage's ruins you gathered that the whole area is shrouded in a sort of 'time loop' of the night the city fell. It serves as a form of punishment, making sure the still living Carthage's defenders are tormented with their defeat forever, and a warding mechanism, as anyone trying to enter the ruins will be trapped in the loop themselves.\nAs such, it is of crucial importance that you think of some escape plan. Troile is likely inside that area so you will have to enter the time loop, find her, diablerize her then escape somehow. Some knowledge about blood or time magic seems like a prerequisite to even have a chance to thwart such a powerful ritual."
 POD_anteshunttroile.2.a:0 "I know my way around magic. I will be fine."
 POD_anteshunttroile.2.b:0 "I know reliable sources to find a solution."
 POD_anteshunttroile.2.c:0 "This is madness, I should give up."
 given_up_troile_hunt_tt:0 "You lack the minimum skills to escape the time loop. Troile is out of your reach but you will be brought back to the choice of other [antediluvians|E] to potentially consume."
