 culture_era_dark_fantastic_desc:0 "At the dawn of the Early Modern era new continents are being mapped while feudal society is slowly giving way to centralized states."
 culture_era_gothic_victorian:0 "Gothic Victorian"
 culture_era_gothic_victorian_desc:0 "The name 'Gothic Victorian' references the two sensibilities that inform the setting: the brooding, doomed romanticism of classical Gothic fiction and the reign of Queen Victoria I of the United Kingdom, who ruled the British Empire from June 20, 1837, until her death on January 22, 1901. These two sensibilities both infer a concern with radical social change as it alternately coexists and clashes with the repressive weight of tradition. The Victorian Gothic age, as featured in Victorian Age: Vampire, spans from the years 1890 to 1897 and ends not with Victoria's death, but with Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. This event rocked the Kindred world to its core. The Victorian Gothic period partially overlaps with the Savage West (or "Wyld West"), the setting of Werewolf: The Wild West. However, the theme and tone of the two settings differ significantly. The forthcoming Victorian Mage for Mage: The Ascension will also deal with the Victorian Age."

 culture_era_final_nights_desc:0 "In [cainite|E] eschatology, the Final Nights are the nights before the coming of Gehenna and the end of vampires. Much of the basis for belief in the Final Nights originates with Noddist lore. Specifically, the Book of Nod. The Final Nights are supposed to be predated by several signs which indicate great changes in [cainite|E] society and the imminent wakening of the [antediluvians|E], such as a rise in the number of thin-blooded vampires, Princedoms ruled by Caitiff, and Kuei-jin invading the West. It is said that the majority of vampires have a sense of impending doom during the Final Nights."
