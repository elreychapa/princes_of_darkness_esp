 artifact_book_of_nod_name:0 "Book of Nod"
 artifact_book_of_nod_description:0 "A collection of ancient texts, viewed as sacred to Noddist Cainites. It consists of multiple recensions and fragments that have been reassembled by various Kindred scholars. Traditionally, the primary transmission of Caine's story is oral, while the texts with the most important events in Cainite history are heavily guarded to protect the Cainites. It must be mentioned that one's own personal beliefs aside, the texts and notes that have been passed down through the ages should be treated with great caution. There are numerous open questions concerning the history of the Book of Nod. Its author is unknown, though Malkav, Saulot, and even Caine are often cited to have written parts of it, if not the whole thing. However, it may have had many authors and editors over the thousands of years since the time of the events which it describes, placing great doubts on its veracity. Some consider the entire book to be myths or lies, a story vampires invented to explain their existence or a tool used to mislead others into thinking and acting a certain way. Adding to these doubts is the fact that many writings attributed to the Book of Nod are incredibly vague or contradictory, sometimes appearing to be outright misdirection – which creates some large (and often violent) schisms of interpretation between Noddist groups. The oldest piece of the Book is dated to just before the time of Sumer, around 4500 BCE."
 artifact_chronicle_of_caine_name:0 "Chronicle of Caine"
 artifact_chronicle_of_caine_description:0 "A Chronicle of 'The Book of Nod'. This tome comprises the following fragments: The First of Times, The Coming of Lilith, Lilith's Magick, The Temptation of Caine, Zillah's Tale, The Tale of the Crone, and The Tale of the First City. Although Caine is identified with the 'Cain' mentioned in the Book of Genesis, these Tales are not to be comparatively accurate with standard biblical canon. In his own words, Caine relates what his motives were that led to his curse, giving his personal viewpoints of the events that surrounded the days after the Fall of Man, and his history of being the Dark Father."
 artifact_chronicle_of_shadows_name:0 "Chronicle of Shadows"
 artifact_chronicle_of_shadows_description:0 "A Chronicle of 'The Book of Nod'. A collection of pieces and fragments that are debated to even be part of the Book of Nod. There are analysts who claim that this section had been diluted by the scholars and writers of Carthage, who took poetic license to write down 'Caine’s Laws.' It has even been said that the Chronicle of Shadows is just a collection of propaganda created by the Camarilla to support its tyrannical reign. While some believe this to be an elaborate Malkavian prank, others believe these texts came straight from the Dark Father himself, especially the thirteen commandments that were provided on authentically aged tablets."
 artifact_chronicle_of_secrets_name:0 "Chronicle of Secrets"
 artifact_chronicle_of_secrets_description:0 "A Chronicle of 'The Book of Nod'. It contains prophecies and visions of an event called Gehenna.
