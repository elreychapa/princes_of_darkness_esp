 POD_investigate.1.desc.camilla:0 "Perhaps the most influential Ventrue of history, Titus Venturus Camille was a promising young Roman tutored by the best teachers, be they Collat, his future [Sire|E] and Prince of Rome, or Lysander and Artemis Orthia of Sparta. A strong sense of rulership and a devouring ambition were soon born, and Camilla took his [Sire|E]'s throne, some say by [diablerie|E]. He will then rule Rome from the Republican era to the Imperial one, pioneering the Eternal Senate and the concept of Masquerade. It is also his command that took down the city of Carthage, earning him the enmity of Brujah for all eternity.\n Even more famously, Camilla would fall in with the burgeoning Road of Sin and become one of its more... skillful adepts. Despite his carefree and sometimes indolent attitude, Camilla managed to keep the reins of power over most of the [cainite|E] world for a millennia, a feat never seen before or after. \n He felt into [torpor|E] at the end of the Roman Imperial era, and every semblance of unity in the [cainite|E] world fell with him. He finally awakens in 1230 and easily slips back into power in Rome. But the world has changed much, and it is unlikely that the Prince of Sin will be able to once again rule over Europe. \n Future fate in Canon \n Camilla will fall into [torpor|E] during the Medieval era, only to rise in the early 21st century. An old foe will await his return to avenge a grudge as old as Rome itself."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.mithras:0 "Once a soldier in the first days of Persia, Mithras has made quite a legacy for himself. Using his powers and incontestable skills at manipulation and persuasion, he soon created a new backstory, that of the Sun God of the same name. This allowed him to be one of the most powerful Ventrue of the ancient world, especially when his cult spreads to Imperial Rome. \n But Christianity and his many rivals got the better of him, and he fled with his following to the frontiers of the Empire, in Britain. The pettiness of the place quickly bore him and he fell into a cycle of [torpor|E], awakening to find everything in shambles due to incompetent regents, fixing it, and then [torpor|E] again. \n The last cycle was after 1066, when ambitious Norman Vampires ousted his power base from the island, forcing him to awaken once more and deal with it. As of 1230, the Sun God is once again annoyed by Britain and his influence is strong enough that he could consider another retreat into the sleep of ages. Though it is said that the upstart Hardestadt, claiming overlordship over [Clan|E] Ventrue, is angering his much older clanmate. This could be reason enough for him to stay a little while longer... \n Future fate in Canon \n Mithras will stay awake for some time, being a thorn on the side of Hardestadt during the Camarilla's foundation. He felt into [torpor|E] once more, to finally be killed in 1996 when Valerius, one of his former regents, betrays him. Though, some spoke of a contingency plan..."

John hasn't forgotten his freedom from before though, and is one of the main conspirators against the Persian Methuselah's rule.

He will be entrusted with keeping Ceoris safe after the departure of the Council and will do so admirably, weathering the Tzimisce, Hermetics and even the Nazi and Communist regimes.

 POD_investigate.2.desc.pakourianis:0 "In life, Pakourianis was a skilled painter who came to the attention of Michael since his adolescence. After being Embraced, Pakourianis acted as his sire's muse of paintings.\nPakourianis was deeply influenced by his sire, believing him to be a literal manifestation of the archangel. When the methuselah became more and more withdrawn, Pakourianis feared that he would leave without him and became obsessed with flying. Most often, he flung himself frustrated into the ocean.\nPakourianis survived the sack of Constantinople in 1204 CE, but it took a toll on his sanity. He continued his quest to learn how to fly, striving to follow Michael into heaven. His meditations tempered his anguish, but the flight of birds, Tremere gargoyles and other winged things fascinated him. Together with his broodmate Paul Bathalos, Pakourianis founded the Nephilim, also known as the Children of Michael.\nFuture fate in Canon\nIn the modern nights, Pakourianis will rule over Johannesburg, in South Africa, hoping to restore the Dream in the city, create a new utopia for Kindred, and a possible template for further domains. In a ironic twist however, his grand view will be opposed by the Cainite Heresy, the very same that precipitated Michael's fall so long ago."
 POD_investigate.2.desc.periander:0 "The Prince of Corinth stays aloof from mortal affairs, frowning upon the practice of meddling upon the kine, believing it to be below the Children of Caine. Instead, Periander would prefer that [cainites|E] leave behind the trappings of the world they knew before their [Embrace|E] to concentrate on higher things such as the vampiric utopia many Brujah elders seek. To this end, Periander has taken great interest in New Lacadaemonia and he hopes that it can serve as an example to be emulated in Corinth."
 POD_investigate.2.desc.ravik:0 "A creature with feral eyes and a flesh the texture of smoked heat, Ravik is often mistaken for a Nosferatu but his prowess in battle and usage of [disciplines|E] quickly correct any potential mistakes. Ravik moves with a sizable pack of Gangrel and his goal seems to be the protection of his region from werewolves and any other outsiders he identifies as threats. As far as politics are concerned, Ravik is content to let Princes be Princes, as long as he can keep doing his own form of 'justice'. The reason of such stubbornness is unknown but often rumored to be tied to his deformities.\nFuture fate in Canon\nMoving to Norway, Ravik will partner with Prince Agnethe Sannrste of Oslo to become a powerful force in the region. Refusing any titles or honorifics, he will continue administering his feral justice following a pattern only he understands."
 POD_investigate.2.desc.pu:0 "Pu Shoukeng is the leader of a dying court and he knows it. Always fractious and derided for its nomadic origins by its more "civilized" Chinese counterparts, the Black Tortoise is now feeling the sudden pressure of the Anda Gangrel following Gengis Khan's conquests. With more and more young Wan Kuei falling to despair and worse to worshiping Dokhor, the Yama King of the Hell of Spiked Chains. No help is coming from the South either, as admitting this corrupting presence would result in the reputation of the Black Tortoise court being damaged beyond repairs.\nPu Shoukeng knows that he has already lost and the Fifth Age is coming, and it will be without the Black Tortoise to witness it. Until then, there is nothing else to do but pray for a miracle and prepare for the worst.\nFuture fate in Canon\nThe Black Tortoise's court corruption will grow to leave only a handful of true Wan Kuei in its midst. Fleeing South, they will warn the other Courts who will then proceed to march North and destroy any traces of it, before erasing the records of its shameful existence entirely."

Disappearing almost as soon as he showed up in her life, Sanak was left to fend for her own. Luckily, a chieftain's daughter is not without her resources.\nShe has charmed a rudimentary Ashirra education out of her peers, using her beauty and gentle manners to win some allies. Sanak knows the truth about her [Sire|E], something that could earn her many favors from the Cainites of Yemen but refuses to betray him.

 POD_investigate.2.desc.alexus:0 "Alexus Simocatta was a scholar in Constantinople who also acted as an illustrator and architect. Although his position weakened during the Iconoclast controversy, he was an influential artist and worked on a myriad of projects. During one of the works he supervised, a collapsed scaffolding led to a long fall onto a stone floor, which nearly resulted in his death.\nSimocatta was saved through the blood of the Keeper of the Faith, who believed him to be too useful to die. Though he worked in the Library of the Forgotten, he never felt quite at home in the underground crypts. As a result, he was retained to act as an agent of both his [Sire|E] and the Dracon. He was sent into the Holy Land following the upheaval of the crusades in order to alert his sire of recent developments, cultivating a network of spies and informants that stretched over the whole Middle East.\nThis assignment saved him from the massacres of the Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople.\nFuture fate in Canon\nHe will continue to correspond with his sire for a long time, until his assassination by an unknown Assamite in 1481."
 POD_investigate.2.desc.shabah:0 "After her [Embrace|E], Shabah was abandoned by her [Sire|E] in the North African mountains, testing if she had the potential he had seen in her. After failing to contact her family (who believed her to be an evil ghost), she eventually pursued him and was brought to Alamut for formal recognition.\nShe was sent into the West to learn the ways of the Franj. During her travels, she met Belisarius, a Ventrue from Constantinople, and the two became lovers and married, sharing a Blood Oath with each other until Shabah was called back to Alamut. By that time, her knowledge of the West and the disguise provided by her gender (as others believed all Assamites to be male) have made her quite a proficient assassin, to an extent she even killed Emperor John II Komnenos in 1143, oblivious to the fact that he was one of Belisarius' protegés.\nDuring the rule of Saladin, she was sent to Constantinople, acting as an envoy to Michael to gain his favor and alliance in Alamut's struggle against the various hostile factions (supernatural as well as mortal) within the Middle East. There she met her old lover Belisarius again and reconciled with him, while acting as a professional assassin for the city's various Cainites.\nAfter the fall of Constantinople, she and Belisarius left the city for good and wandered until they met an orphaned neonate, Anadja. Sensing potential in the young woman, they decided to adopt her and start preparing her for the bright destiny they see in her.\nFuture fate in Canon\nShabah will prepare Anadja well but won't see the results of her teachings.

She was saved from her tribe's retribution by a Banu Haqim warrior who has been monitoring her for a while.\nHabiba took to her training as an undead assassin with ease and confidence. After serving her apprenticeship, she was placed in Jerusalem, a position of honor for any young Assamite.

 POD_investigate.2.desc.mahanaga:0 "According to the legends of Asia, the Wan Xian were the 10,000 heroes of the Middle Kingdom. They originally protected the Middle Kingdom from the depredations of the Yama Kings and other threats. Chosen by the August Personage In Jade, they were mortals who passed various tests and acquired the ability to feed off of chi, granting them great power. During their tenure on earth, the Wan Xian learned and amassed power, until they become enlightened enough to enter Heaven. The Ebon Dragon and the Scarlet Phoenix would then appoint a replacement from the mortal population.\nThough valiant, the Wan Xian were not beyond corruption. Legends tell that Mahanaga Visparakti became the very first akuma. The influence of the Yama Kings eventually taught him how to absorb chi from other lifeforms for himself. In time, the Wan Xian that followed him became tyrants, exploiting their mortal subjects and draining them of their chi to make war with each other. Elaborate plotting resulted in the War of Shame, in which the Xiong Ren turned against each other and decimated themselves, while the Wan Xian overtook their sacred sites to feed on them. They twisted the tests that would create new Wan Xian so that unethical, but clever and powerful mortals managed to violate the spirit of these tests and achieve immortality. It is said that their children, the Jin Hai, tried to stop the excesses of their parents, and were slaughtered in return.\nThus began the fall of the Wan Xian towards becoming the Wan Kuei and many place the blame of this corruption on Mahanaga Visparakni's shoulders."
 POD_investigate.2.desc.gulfora:0 "Gulfora is one of the few remaining succubi on Earth. As far as she is concerned, she has existed nearly as long as the earth itself. She claims she came into being on the fourth day of Creation, when God created the beings of the sea and air. However succubi (like all demons) are great liars, and anyone who believes their stories would do well to never trust a sand merchant in the Sahara.\nGulfora's history is a long and bloody one. The Sumerians were the first people to write about her, and their cuneiform warnings about her powers date back to 2300 BCE. Other civilizations, from the Egyptians to the Chinese, have feared her, and rightly so. There is probably no vampire who can match her murder for murder. People of the Western traditions believe she was created along with the other angels, and fell from grace. People of Eastern traditions tend to consider her one of the malevolent forces of nature.\nIn the end, Gulfora's true goals are only known to herself but she has been cornered into serving greater demons from time to time. However, those that end up binding her always seem to meet with some unfortunate accident shortly after...\nFuture fate in Canon\nGulfora's depredations will never truly end. She will follow where pain and misery tread until settling in Chicago, intrigued by the presence of other powerful creatures in the area."

To his surprise however, the jewels were stolen from him while he was away. Three Fenrir, accursed German wolves followers of the Teutons, had planned to reveal Kazimier's treachery to Poland.

 POD_investigate.2.desc.eugenio:0 "An unremarkable vampire by most accounts, Eugenio Vicente de Olisipo's main asset to survive the cutthroat politics of the night seems to be his sheer stubbornness.
